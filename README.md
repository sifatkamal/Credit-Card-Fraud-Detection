# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

For this project I've choosen a dataset from kaggle.com where the dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. In this dataset the target variable is binary. If it's a fake credit card transaction then the outcome will be 1 otherise the outcome will be 0. Since it's binary classification problem so I've implemented a machine learning algorithm Logistic Regression. The dataset is quite unbalanced. For this reason I've taken randomly equal numbers of fraud data for the legit transaction. That means 50% is legit and 50% is fraud. By training the data I've got my desired outcome. For more details I've added a project report.
